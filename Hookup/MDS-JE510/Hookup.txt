HOOKUP INSTRUCTIONS SONY MDS-JE510
---------------------------------------------------
This requires soldering, continue at your own risk!

The arduino needs 3 connections to the MD deck:
+5V, GND, IR DATA.

The chassis is connected to GND so connect the 
a wire from Arduino GND to a mounting screw with good metal connection.

+5V: There is 5V several places in the MD, but I have connected it directly to
IC309 Pin 1. This 5V is active only when power is on, not standby. This saves 
on standby power usage (but cannot wake the MD by keyboard).

Solder a wire onto this pin and connect it to 5V on arduino board. 
Disconnect this wire while you are powering the arduino over usb.

IR DATA:
Solder a wire from pin 3 (bottom pin) on IC702 located on the display card (right behind the power button).
Connect this to Arduino IRDATA PIN (default pin 3).


PS/2 CONNECTOR:
Up to you where to mount it :)
